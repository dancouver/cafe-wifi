This is a Cafe & Wifi API built with Python, using the Flask framework and Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management.

The application provides a RESTful API to find and manage cafes, storing all data in a local SQLite database. 
It serves HTML pages for a user-friendly frontend experience.

Key endpoints allow you to view all cafes, search for cafes in a specific location, add new entries, and report a cafe as closed. 
The deletion endpoint is protected by a static API key to prevent unauthorized changes. It's a complete, self-contained web service for cafe enthusiasts.
